```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
x <- "a\\b"
str_view(x, "\\\\")
```

## Exercise 14.3.1.1
```{r}
# 1. Explain why each of these strings don’t match a \: "\", "\\", "\\\".
###  "\" - A single backslash is an escape character in regular expressions, so R believes the code includes all the characters after it now.
###  "\\" - You could create a regular expression for \ with this, but that isn't a usable string
###  "\\\" - Like with a single backslash, the third one here leaves the code open.
###  "\\\\" - We now have two backslashes surrounding the "\\" that reads as "\"
```

## Exercise 14.3.2.1
```{r}
# 1. How would you match the literal string "$^$"?
x <- c("apple", "$^$")
str_view(x, "\\$\\^\\$")
```

## Exercise 14.3.3.1
### Create regular expressions to find all words that:
```{r}
x <- c("apple", "egg", "speed", "bed", "wise", "wing", "hmm", "psst")
# 1. Start with a vowel.
str_view(x, "^[aeiouy]")
# 2. That only contain consonants. (Hint: thinking about matching “not”-vowels.)
str_view(x, "^[^aeiou]*$")
# 3. End with "ed", but not with "eed".
str_view(x, "[^e]ed$")
# 4. End with "ing" or "ise".
str_view(x, "(ise|ing)$")
```

## Exercise 14.3.4.1
```{r}
# 1. Describe the equivalents of ?, +, * in {m,n} form.
##  ?: 0 or 1
##  +: 1 or more
##  *: 0 or more
#### {0,1}
#### {1,}
#### {0,}
```
